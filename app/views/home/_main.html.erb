      My name is Tim Santos and I started the company, Tim Jedrek, to serve small to medium sized businesses create their online presence and implement software solutions.

      We specialize in the following: <a href="#webdesign" class="text-red-800 hover:underline">Website Design</a>, <a href="#ecommerce" class="text-red-800 hover:underline">E-Commerce</a>, and <a href="#enterprise" class="text-red-800 hover:underline">Enterprise Software</a>

    <!--Website Design-->
    <h2 class="font-bold text-3xl" id="webdesign">Website Design</h2>
    <p class="py-7">
      Websites are an important part of any business and are the digital business card of the company. Every business's online web presence, regardless of industry, will have a massive impact on its success. Many businesses don't realize that a majority of their customers will look for and visit their website before making a purchasing decision. Having a website can be a make or break for generating more revenue.
    </p>
    <h3 class="font-semibold text-xl">Building Credibility and Brand Awareness</h3>
    <p class="pb-7">
      Everyone has an option in choosing which company they will spend their money with. Chances are, prior making a purchase, your customers are looking and evaluating other businesses in the area and most look online to aid them in their decision. One way you can stand out is by having a website that looks good and clearly communicates quality information to your consumers.  Without a website, people may question your legitimacy as a business. Having a website is an opportunity to make a great first impression and give people comfort that you're a real business. Establishing an online presence is a great way to showcase your brand, establish who you are, and increase your chances of you closing that next sale.
    </p>

    <h3 class="font-semibold text-xl">Saving You Time and Providing Excellent Customer Service</h3>
    <p class="pb-7">
      Many businesses get calls from prospects or existing customers asking simple questions about location and hours of operation. If you miss a call, the customer is left unhappy. A website can help customers find useful information without needing to call, which ultimately provides an all-around better member experience.
    </p>

    <h3 class="font-semibold text-xl">What Makes Us Different</h3>
    <p class="pb-7">
      Everyday technology is evolving and publishing a website has become easier than ever.  You may have heard of DIY solutions like Wix, Squarespace, Weebly, Go Daddy, and WordPress.  These are all great options and can be cost effective, however these platforms while at first may seem easy to use, over time problems start to arise.  Our websites are all handcrafted and coded line by line to optimize efficiency and improve quality.
    </p>
    <p class="pb-7">
      <b>Security</b><br>
      Because DIY and no-code platforms are so widely used, without the technical expertise, your site will be constantly under attack from spambots, malware, and viruses.  Once these malicious scripts get ahold of your domain name and server, not only will they compromise your website, they can spread to your personal computer & phone and then access your passwords, emails, and even your bank account information.  Tim Jedrek does not use WordPress or any other DIY platforms and instead, each website we make is handcrafted and coded line by line which will divert away most attacks.  In addition, we employ different security protocols including proprietary verification techniques, recaptcha, and two factor authentication.  
    </p>
    <p class="pb-7">
      <b>Customization, Layout, and Design</b><br>
      Using drag and drop and no-code solutions becomes tedious to get your site looking the way you actually want it to.  Especially as most customers will first view your site on their phone, your design can become completely destroyed when the screen size changes.  Tim Jedrek takes this into account and will develop your site using modern web technologies to make your site look great in whatever screen your customer is viewing your website through.  We take extra consideration to ensure that the user experience when viewing your site is intuitive, creative, and dynamic.  Our designs are simple, modern, professional, and palatable. 
    </p>
    <p class="pb-7">
      <b>Speed</b><br>
      Using no-code and DIY solutions comes with a cost in performance and speed.  These platforms come overloaded with bloatware and excess code which in turn brings longer load times.  Since our websites are made from scratch, your website is able to be loaded quickly.  In addition to the software running the site, your web host also plays a big factor in page load times.  Tim Jedrek has done the research to find the most affordable and fastest service providers.  We do not use shared hosting like Bluehost or Hostgator which serves thousands of clients and gives the bare minimum.  Instead, we use Linode, Amazon, and Google to deploy your site on a dedicated private server in the cloud.  This means that your customers will be able to access your site quickly and rapidly.
    </p>
    <p class="pb-7">
      <b>Cost</b><br>
      Tim Jedrek is an affordable high quality solution to get a handcrafted website that is designed to your liking.  As your business scales and your traffic increases, we will not increase your price.  Other platforms take advantage of when there is increased traffic and demand higher prices.  We have chosen to honor the price that has been set and we will never increase your costs.  That's our guarantee to you.  
    </p>
    <h3 class="font-semibold text-xl">Let's Get to Work!</h3>
    <p class="pb-7">
    Every client we have is special to us and we want to take the time to really get to know you and your business.
